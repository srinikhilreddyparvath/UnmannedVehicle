# UnmannedVehicle
Design and implementation of Multi-Functional Autonomous vehicle
Agriculture and industrial sectors have been long physical task and labor extensive
areas. Indeed, even in India, these regions date back to before the Indus Valley Civilization and employ nearly half of the country’s population today, contributing 18 to 19
percent of the nation’s GDP. This can be substantially improved by combining traditional
farming techniques with modern electronic devices and IoT-based advancements.
The solution entails developing a model of independent automated transportation capabilities that is able to make farmers and workers life easy by removing the need for
labor and physical work for menial task. This includes but is not limited to smart transportation, carriage, smart farming, smart logistical solutions etc The solution combines
state of the art IOT advancement with modern day sensors all in a plug and play package.
Such a model can also create a vehicle that readily follows a path using object identification and line following. This vehicle can be used in processing plants, godowns,
healthcare facilities, emergency rooms, nurseries, mining, and other settings.
Physically controlled vehicles fall short of the standards of a project that aims for
independent control. Therefore, a step is taken forward by using node to node communication and a crucial setup of Arduino, Sensors, and Microcontrollers to work toward
developing a model that can independently move loads from one point to the next.
the models proposed can be utilised in many a sectors including agriculture and industrial. Line following capabilities find extensive usage in pre determined path works
such as those on working lands, factories or godowns. Hand following capabilities provide
logistical solutions for easy carriages of load in factories or Farms. Node to node communication vehicle can be used for all said cases but it also provides more control and
customisability the user with its application and functionalities it can perform. All in all
the 2 models proposed find extensive usecase in real world and helps to take India’s first
step towards electronic and IOT automation in farming agriculture and related sectors
The Existing models that are more than 100Kgs will now the Smaller with the ability
to carry more weight with no malfunction with respect to overheating. Automation has
come a huge step to resolve the existing problems that can be eradicated.
